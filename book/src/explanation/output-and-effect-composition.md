# Output and Effect Composition
This chapter will cover the ways that effects compose, starting with the most basic and getting more advanced.

## Combined effects
The canonical form of "effect composition" is the combined effect, which is simply a tuple of effects.
The `Effect` trait is implemented for tuples where each element of the tuple also implements `Effect`.
The `affect` system will perform their effects from left to right.

So, if you want a system that has 2 or more effects of heterogenous type, you can just return their tuple.
